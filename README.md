A braindump of ideas: what would a mobile-first programming language
look like?

## Inspirations

* Type-based refinement
* Smalltalk

## Other projects

Coding on smartphones:

* [vimtouch](https://github.com/momodalo/vimtouch)
* Task-based apps, such as
  [Llama](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kebab.Llama&hl=en)
  and [Tasker](http://tasker.dinglisch.net/) showcase the sort of
  functionality a smartphone language might target

Coding on larger touchscreens:

* [Lisping](http://slidetocode.com/lisping) (see the
  [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaMcFjje9sQHnNllR_P8AzA))
* [swift playgrounds](https://developer.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/)

Structured editing:

* Paredit (see
  [The Animated Guide to Paredit](http://danmidwood.com/content/2014/11/21/animated-paredit.html))
* [Lispy](https://github.com/abo-abo/lispy)
* Unison (see [About Unison](http://unisonweb.org/2015-05-07/about.html#post-start))

UIs that promote fiddling:

* Browser consoles, especially Firefox's persistent script editor
* Emacs (modifying settings is just setting variables)
* Squeak's 'halos' allow a level of UI fiddling that even beats a web
  browser
* [Hyperdev](https://hyperdev.com) has a good stripped-down UI

Arguably minecraft is in this same category.
